maybe shift literal parsing to parse step rather than lexer

error: separate error types for synatx, type, expression etc

for parser: don't store bracket tokens for groups

for stack: grows 8 bytes downwards for each 64 bit integer

allocate stack space first and then mov to m64 rather than push each var

CHANGE SYMBOL AND LITERAL/PRIMARY!!!
